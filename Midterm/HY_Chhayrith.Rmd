This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# 1. Write a R code to Generate 6X6 matrix (A) using the random numbers between 1 to 100 generate another 6x6 matrix (B) using random numbers between 500 to 600.
data_a = 1:100
data_b = 500:600

matrix_A = matrix(data_a, 6, 6, byrow = T)
matrix_A
matrix_B = matrix(data_b, 6, 6, byrow = T)
matrix_B

# a. Find the range of matrices A and B.
dim(matrix_A)
dim(matrix_B)

# b. Find the max value from each row of the matrices A and B.
apply(matrix_A,1,max)
apply(matrix_B,1,max)

# c. Find the diagonal values of matrices A&amp;B.
diag(matrix_A)
diag(matrix_B)

# d. Multiply matrices A and B
result = matrix_A %*% matrix_B
result

# e. Replace the 4th row of Matrix A with diagonal values of matrix B
matrix_A[4,] = diag(matrix_B)
matrix_A

# f. Multiply matrices A & B and store the values on X.
X = matrix_A %*% matrix_B
X

# g. Divide the matrix A with matrix B.
Y = matrix_A / matrix_B
Y

# 2. Create a table using dataframe/tibble with the following categories(a to f) 
fName <- c("Chhay", "Bunrong", "Senghak", "Chhuny","Kimmonyvorn","Nataly","Panha","Dalya","Menghong","Jenny")
lName <- c("Rith", "Kit", "Heng", "Am","Chea","Chea","Chean","Daro","Chor","Sun")
age <- c(20, 21, 23, 20, 19, 20, 21, 22, 19, 20)

# 3. Create a .txt file (Minimum : 150 words) with the latest news (In English) in cambodia from the official news agency’s website(Note: Include the reference link) and do the following
library(tokenizers)
library(sentimentr)

#a. Read the .txt file
news_data <- read.delim("en_US.blog.txt")

#b. Perform the Tokenization &amp; count the words
words_data <- paste0(news_data)
tokens <- tokenize_words(words_data)
count <- count_words(words_data)
print(count)

#c. Identify the most repeated word and replace that word with “KIT”
most_words <- names(table(tokens))[as.vector(table(tokens))==max(table(tokens))]
most_words_count <- max(table(tokens))
subs <- gsub("to", "KIT", tokens)
print(most_words)
print(most_words_count)
print(subs)

#d. Perform the Sentiment analysis
exm <- data.frame(text=words_data)
result1<- sentiment(exm$text) # To know number of sentences and words(Sentiment at the sentence level)
result1
result2 <-sentiment_by(exm$text) # Total number of words
result2
result3<- get_sentences(exm) # To display the sentences
result3
result4<- emotion(exm$text) # Emotion at the sentence level
result4
result5<- emotion_by(exm$text) # Aggregated emotion by group(s)
result5
result6<- profanity(exm$text) # Profanity at the sentence level
result6
result7<- profanity_by(exm$text) # Aggregated profanity by group(s)
result7
```



```{r}
# 4. Find the assigned Dataset from the list below and perform the following (20 Marks)
library("tidyverse")

# a. Import and Clean the dataset.
dataset <- read_csv("cabinet_turnover.csv")
dataset
# the dataset is already clean

# b. Find the x and y variables(axis) from the assigned dataset and give the reason
# Reason : Selecting Position as X and Length as Y because it would be easy to view Length in Y axis. If we do this we can view each Length in the column graph that easy to understand.

plot <- ggplot(dataset, aes(x=position, y=length)) + 
    xlab("Position") +
    ylab("Length")

# c. Plot the graph using geom_col() and perform the linear model in statistics.
# using geom_col
plot <- plot+geom_col()

#perform linear model in smooting
plot <- plot+geom_smooth(method="lm")
plot

# d. Perform the facet with the available columns(Choose the any two variables from the columns)
# use facet with 2 variable by Appointee and days
plot+facet_grid(appointee~days)

```
